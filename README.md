# image-compression-transmission-grasp-detection
A GAN-based cooperative grasp detection approach for edge cloud.


## Description
In this work, we propose a robotic arm grasping approach based on deep learning and edge-cloud collaboration. This approach realizes the arbitrary grasp planning of the robot arm and considers the grasp efficiency and information security.
